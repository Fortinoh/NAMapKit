NAMapKit
========

Allows you to use custom maps in iOS applications and attempts to mimics some of the behaviour of the MapKit framework.

Useage
------

Create a NAMapView and give it a map to display. If you are using Interface Builder, add a UIScrollView and change the class to NAMapView (see demo app).
